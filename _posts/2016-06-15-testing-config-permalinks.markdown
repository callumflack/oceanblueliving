When we work with Stateful Themes (that is to say, themes that we toggle on and off) we normally do so by adding a class to the body element. Examples of this approach to theming include style-switchers (a user can toggle between different themes) and sub-sections of a site (all blog posts have one theme colour, all news pages have another theme colour, etc.). We simply add a class high up the DOM which then invokes that theme for that particular page.

A simple way to denote any theme-related classes is to simply prepend them with t-. Seeing a t- class in your HTML should tell you that Ah, right, the view probably looks the way it currently does because we have a theme invoked.

Now, all of the namespaces weâ€™ve looked at so far are mainly of use to us in our markup, but Theme namespaces are helpful in both our HTML and our CSS. Seeing, for example, .t-light in our markup tells us that the entire DOM has a current state applied to it, which is important to know whilst debugging. Seeing that class in our CSS also tells us a lot: it helps to sandbox and isolate any chunks of theme-related CSS inside namespaced rulesets:
