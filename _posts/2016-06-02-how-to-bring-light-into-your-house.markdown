Every day Airbnb hosts open their homes to travelers looking for a new adventure. These experiences are only possible because of the trust our community puts in one another and the trust they’ve put in us. Our mission is to create a world in which anyone can belong anywhere, and that’s only possible when people feel comfortable. We’re proud that to date over 80 million guests have had safe, positive experiences staying with hosts in over 191 countries worldwide.

Today, we’re excited to share our Standards and Expectations. These guidelines are an expression of the shared values of the Airbnb community, and they were created based on what hosts and guests have told us they view as acceptable conduct and behavior when using Airbnb.

As the Airbnb community continues to grow, the Standards and Expectations will evolve as our community does. As a people to people online platform that is always growing, we are always going to be taking learnings and seeking to apply them to support our community. While we will evolve, the policies will always reflect our core values and the behaviors we expect from the people who are part of the Airbnb community.

These guidelines are based on five core standards: Safety, Security, Fairness, Authenticity and Reliability. Each of these standards comes with expected behaviors from hosts and guests in the Airbnb community. Since every experience on Airbnb is unique, we understand that things come up and unexpected circumstances arise, and we take this into account when reviewing and enforcing these guidelines.
