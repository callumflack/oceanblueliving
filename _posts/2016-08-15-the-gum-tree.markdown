The Gum Tree is a custom project for Georgetown Council to commemorate the people who helped shape Einasleigh from World War One through to today.

Made from 8 sheets of 3mm corten steel welded together, and measuring 2.5m high and wide, each sheet is a sculpted tree shape with the names of townsfolk engraved on leaves.

Wendi Furber, the driving force behind the Gum Tree project, says it had been an idea she had for many years but didn't find a tipping point until she found OceanBlue Living:

> The tree symbolises enduring strength and knowledge in our community. The branches reach to the heavens and the roots go deep into the earth and all are woven together - the past and the present, heaven and earth.

The Gum Tree is being installed in Einasleigh's main public park soon.
