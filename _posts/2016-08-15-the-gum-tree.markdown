The Gum Tree is a custom project for Georgetown Council to commemorate the people who helped shape Einasleigh from World War One through to today.

Made from 6 sheets of 3mm corten steel welded together, and measuring 2.5m high and wide, each sheet is a sculpted tree shape with the names of townsfolk engraved on leaves.

Wendi Furber, the driving force behind the Gum Tree project, says it had been an idea she had for many years but didn't find a tipping point until she found OceanBlue Living:

> I have had the idea of the tree for about 6 years now but could not find anyone to make it a reality until I found a brochure about OceanBlue Living - in a dentist waiting room! After I made my first phone call to LeeAnne & Vince it has all come together over a period of time. They have been very helpful and patient as we had to apply for grants and council permission (all takes a long time). I would recommend them to anyone looking for that something that is just that little bit different. Their showroom is full of exciting and innovative works of art for the home and garden.

The Gum Tree is being installed in Einasleigh Town Park soon.
