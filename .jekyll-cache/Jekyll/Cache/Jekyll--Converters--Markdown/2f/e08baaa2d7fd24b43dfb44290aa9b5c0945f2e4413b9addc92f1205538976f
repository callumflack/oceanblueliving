I"ï<p>Last Thursday it was 36 degrees and 66% humidity at 11am. I found myself desperately seeking an air-conditioned space in the city centre of Cairns for a coffee meeting and a bit blogging.</p>

<p>In my heated search for a comfortable cool oasis, I thought to myself, I absolutely love the new works that have reshaped the look of the city centre. The ability to drive through on Lake Street, the u-turning lanes on Grafton Street, the ally bars, the funky cafes and of course our amazing new Cairns School of Arts. Iâ€™m proud of our little changing city and while I donâ€™t know what the future plans are for the area, I got to thinking about transforming spaces and buildings that need a little facelift.</p>

<p>One thing I love about visiting bigger cities in Australia is the use of Facades to create a contemporary feel and really sets the scene. As I was doing my wandering I spotted a few buildings which I thought would look amazing with custom designed facades. Perhaps with a tropical patterns, or even using the vision of an architect or artist to create something truly unique. Because, you know, we can do that.</p>

<p>Facades are a great way to modernise an existing building, attract attention of locals and visitors like no other feature can. Especially since theyâ€™re designed and manufactured locally with framing, brackets, fixings etc where required, ready for immediate (and easy) onsite installation.Â </p>

<p>So the hero shot on this post if a photoshop mock-up I did of one inner city building next to the school of arts. Here it is again, just because. I reckon facades could rock our little city.</p>
