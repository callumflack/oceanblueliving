hero_headline: Timeless, artistic & functional architectural metalworks.
hero_description: Our weatherproof architectural metalworks are durable both indoors
  and out, sculpting light and anchoring spaces to transform your living area. From
  screens, panels, gates and letterbox plates, to signage, wall and garden art, we
  create your designs.

screens_second_text: 'Screens reshape spaces. Add shade and privacy, add a visual
  break, hide or reframe a view, segment a room, redirect routes through your house
  or office, and at the same time, make the objects functional and beautiful. Our
  screens are weatherproof, so they can be used both indoors and outdoors. They''re
  durable: we guarantee our finishes to industry standards, and all our screens can
  withstand [cyclonic? conditions / winds up to 180km?]. And our materials are sustainable:
  [X goes here].'
gates_first_text: OceanBlue Living gates are just like our screens, just with swing
  and lock mechanisms. Our gates are strong and durable yet aesthetically pleasing
  and blend into your surrounding environment.

  but as custom designed architectural objects, they complement and enhance your living
  spaces rather than compromising them. Our pattern designs increase privacy and allow

  codes, including safe edges, and are installed with the technical craftsmanship
  we pride ourselves on.\n\nSustainable, durableâ€¦ Load-tested to [industry standard
