hero_headline: Timeless, elegant & functional architectural metalworks.
hero_description: Our weatherproof architectural metalworks are durable both indoors
  and out, sculpting light and anchoring spaces to transform your living area. From
  screens, panels, gates and letterbox plates, to signage, wall and garden art, we
  create your designs.
screens_first_text: Parasoleil panels used overhead create shade with air circulation,
  bridge architecture with nature and create interactive shadows that change over
  the day. Here's a bit more to line things up.

screens_second_text: 'Filter intense sunlight while allowing air flow circulation
  with this line of open pattern aluminum and copper panels, cut-out with designs
  to bridge architecture with nature. All-weather shade products create an interesting
  and inviting space as the shadows move with the sun. Durable finishes, sustainable
  materials, and versatile patterns are reliable tools to design places where people
  want to be. Standard shade panels are for installations with wind loads up to 100
  mph and snow loads up to 100 lb/sf using Parasoleil’s own brackets and hardware.  '
