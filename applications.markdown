hero_headline: Timeless, elegant & functional architectural pieces.
hero_description: "Our architectural metal panels filter and sculpt light. They’re not only engineered
  to withstand the elements, they’re also profoundly artistic.\n\nFrom screens, panels,
  gates and letterbox plates, to signage, wall and garden art, we create your designs.
  \n\nOur products are proudly designed and built in our Cairns workshop. "

screens_second_text: 'Filter intense sunlight while allowing air flow circulation
  with this line of open pattern aluminum and copper panels, cut-out with designs
  to bridge architecture with nature. All-weather shade products create an interesting
  and inviting space as the shadows move with the sun. Durable finishes, sustainable
  materials, and versatile patterns are reliable tools to design places where people
  want to be. Standard shade panels are for installations with wind loads up to 100
  mph and snow loads up to 100 lb/sf using Parasoleil’s own brackets and hardware.  '
