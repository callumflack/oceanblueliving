hero_headline: Timeless, artistic & functional architectural metalworks.
hero_description: Our weatherproof architectural metalworks are versatile for both
  indoor and outdoor living, sculpting light and anchoring areas to transform your
  living spaces. From screens, panels, gates and letterboxes, to signage, wall art
  and garden sculpture, we create and manufacture your designs.
screens_first_text: OceanBlue Living Screens reshape living spaces. Segment spaces,
  reframe views and create shade and privacy by filtering light.

screens_second_text: Screens reshape spaces. Add shade and privacy, add a visual break,
  hide or reframe a view, segment a room, redirect routes through your house or office,
  and at the same time, make the objects functional and beautiful. Our screens are
  weatherproof, so they can be used both indoors and outdoors. And they're durable—we
  guarantee our finishes to industry standards. Our screens surpass building compliance
  codes and are precisely installed to the highest standard.
gates_first_text: Just like our screens, OceanBlue Living Gates are secure and durable
  yet aesthetically pleasing to blend into your surrounding environment. They can
  be remotely operated with buttons or your smartphone.

gates_second_text: Safe, strong and secure, our gates are function as they should,
  but as custom designed architectural objects, they complement and enhance your living
  spaces rather than compromising them. Our pattern designs increase privacy with
  restricting airflow, and allow a great range versatility in application. All our
  gates surpass building compliance codes, including safe edges, and are installed
  with the technical craftsmanship we pride ourselves on.
outdoor_first_text: OceanBlue Living Outdoor metalworks include letterboxes, fire-pits,
  columns and sculpture. With our versatile cutting technology, if you have an idea,
  we can create it.

outdoor_second_text: Our outdoor metalworks broaden your living spaces—which is especially
  useful in tropical Queensland—by complementing your existing living spaces using
  architectural objects that blend into your natural surroundings. All-weather durable
  finishes and materials mean the objects improve in appearance with age. Of course,
  we can design and cut any pattern you wish, to match your living space. And some
  of our fire-pits even fold away, to avoid inevitable backyard cricket crashes.
