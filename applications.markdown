screens_second_text: 'Screens reshape spaces. Add shade and privacy, add a visual
  break, hide or reframe a view, segment a room, redirect routes through your house
  or office, and at the same time, make the objects functional and beautiful. Our
  screens are weatherproof, so they can be used both indoors and outdoors. And they''re
  durable—we guarantee our finishes to industry standards. Our screens surpass building
  compliance codes and are precisely installed to the highest standard.

'
gates_first_text: 'Just like our screens, OceanBlue Living Gates are secure and durable
  yet aesthetically pleasing to blend into your surrounding environment. They can
  be remotely operated with buttons or your smartphone.

gates_second_text: 'Safe, strong and secure, our gates are function as they should,
  but as custom designed architectural objects, they complement and enhance your living
  spaces rather than compromising them. Our pattern designs increase privacy with
  restricting airflow, and allow a great range versatility in application. All our
  gates surpass building compliance codes, including safe edges, and are installed
  with the technical craftsmanship we pride ourselves on.

outdoor_first_text: 'OceanBlue Living Outdoor metalworks include letterboxes, fire-pits,
  columns and sculpture. With our versatile cutting technology, if you have an idea,
  we can create it.

outdoor_second_text: 'Our outdoor metalworks broaden your living spaces—which is especially
  useful in tropical Queensland—by complementing your existing living spaces using
  architectural objects that blend into your natural surroundings. All-weather durable
  finishes and materials mean the objects improve in appearance with age. Of course,
  we can design and cut any pattern you wish, to match your living space. And some
  of our fire-pits even fold away, to avoid inevitable backyard cricket crashes.
