hero_headline: Timeless, artistic & functional architectural metalworks.
hero_description: Our weatherproof architectural metalworks are durable both indoors
  and out, sculpting light and anchoring spaces to transform your living area. From
  screens, panels, gates and letterbox plates, to signage, wall and garden art, we
  create your designs.
screens_first_text: OceanBlue Living screens reshape living spaces. Segment spaces,
  reframe views and create shade and privacy by adding and filtering light.

screens_second_text: 'Screens reshape spaces. Add shade and privacy, add a visual
  break, hide or reframe a view, segment a room, redirect routes through your house
  or office, and at the same time, make the objects functional and beautiful. Our
  screens are weatherproof, so they can be used both indoors and outdoors. They''re
  durable: we guarantee our finishes to industry standards, and all our screens can
  withstand [cyclonic? conditions / winds up to 180km?]. And our materials are sustainable:
  [X goes here]. Our screens surpass building compliance codes and are precisely installed
  to the highest standard.'
gates_first_text: OceanBlue Living gates are just like our screens, just with swing
  and lock mechanisms. Our gates are strong and durable yet aesthetically pleasing
  and blend into your surrounding environment.

gates_second_text: "Safe, strong and secure, our gates are function as they should,
  but as custom designed architectural objects, they complement and enhance your living
  spaces rather than compromising them. Our pattern designs increase privacy and allow
  a great range versatility in application. All our gates surpass building compliance
  codes, including safe edges, and are installed with the technical craftsmanship
  we pride ourselves on.\n\nSustainable, durable… Load-tested to [industry standard
  weight?]. [wind loads up to 100 mph and snow loads up to 100 lb/sf]. "

outdoor_second_text: "Our outdoor metalworks broaden your living spaces—which is especially
  useful in tropical Queensland—by complementing your existing living spaces with
  metalwork objects that blend with your natural surroundings.\n\n…Durable finishes,
  sustainable materials, and versatile patterns are reliable tools to design places
  where people want to be. \n\nRailings create a sense of safety and subtle element
  of design branding when using load-tested railing insert panels cut with patterns
  for security, edge safety, building code compliance, and complementing a variety
  of architectural styles.  Finishes are exterior-grade and durable in high traffic
  public areas and extreme weather.  Contact Parasoleil’s design team for guidance
  in the best ways to support and fasten panels with custom framework installations.\n\nFilter
  intense sunlight while allowing air flow circulation with this line of open pattern
  aluminum and copper panels, cut-out with designs to bridge architecture with nature.
  All-weather shade products create an interesting and inviting space as the shadows
  move with the sun. Durable finishes, sustainable materials, and versatile patterns
  are reliable tools to design places where people want to be. Standard shade panels
  are for installations with wind loads up to 100 mph and snow loads up to 100 lb/sf
  using Parasoleil’s own brackets and hardware. "
