  create your designs.

screens_second_text: 'Screens reshape spaces. Add shade and privacy, add a visual
  break, hide or reframe a view, segment a room, redirect routes through your house
  or office, and at the same time, make the objects functional and beautiful. Our
  screens are weatherproof, so they can be used both indoors and outdoors. They''re
  durable: we guarantee our finishes to industry standards, and all our screens can
  withstand [cyclonic? conditions / winds up to 180km?]. And our materials are sustainable:
  [X goes here].'
gates_first_text: Parasoleil panels used overhead create shade with air circulation,
  bridge architecture with nature and create interactive shadows that change over
  the day. Here's a bit more to line things up.

gates_second_text: 'Filter intense sunlight while allowing air flow circulation with
  this line of open pattern aluminum and copper panels, cut-out with designs to bridge
  architecture with nature. All-weather shade products create an interesting and inviting
  space as the shadows move with the sun. Durable finishes, sustainable materials,
  and versatile patterns are reliable tools to design places where people want to
  be. Standard shade panels are for installations with wind loads up to 100 mph and
  snow loads up to 100 lb/sf using Parasoleilâ€™s own brackets and hardware.  '
