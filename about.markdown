first_text: "We’re boat builders by trade. We were seduced by the weight, feel and
  versatility of water-jet cutting, so we decided to start our own workshop. Eight
  years later, we’re only just beginning.\n\nFounded by Vince and LeaAnne Cassaniti
  in 2008, OceanBlue Living has evolved from a two-person workshop into a team of
  craftspeople with specialist, multiple skillsets who know how to bring design techniques
  to metalworks.\n \nWe believe in the transformational effect of spaces: spaces that
  people want to be in, that help people live and work. As our lives become faster,
  having space to regain ourselves becomes more important. The presence and natural
  beauty of our sculpted architectural metalworks helps create those spaces."

  The biggest thing our clients say about working with us, is we’re good at helping people through the process. Because there’s so much you can do, sometimes it’s overwhelming. We’ve been doing it a while, so we know how to turn that idea in your head into a useful, artistic object.

  We're here to help you discover, design and fabricate architectural pieces that will transform your living space.
