first_text: "We’re boat builders by trade. We were seduced by the weight, feel and
  versatility of water-jet metal cutting, so we decided to start our own metalworks
  shop for artistic,  functional architectural objects. Eight years later, we’re only
  just beginning.\n\nFounded by Vince and LeaAnne Cassaniti in 2008, OceanBlue Living
  has evolved from a two-person workshop into a team of craftspeople with both design
  techniques and technical skillsets who have the knowhow and experience to bring
  your ideas to life.\n \nWe believe in the transformational effect of spaces: spaces
  that people want to be in, that help people live and work. As our lives become faster,
  having space to regain ourselves becomes more important. The presence and natural
  beauty of our architectural pieces helps create those spaces."

  The biggest thing our clients say about working with us, is we’re good at helping people through the process. Because there’s so much you can do, sometimes it’s overwhelming. We’ve been doing it a while, so we know how to turn that idea in your head into a useful, artistic object.

  We're here to help you discover, design and fabricate architectural pieces that will transform your living space.
