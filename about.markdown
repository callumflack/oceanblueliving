first_text: "We’re boat builders by trade. We were seduced by the weight, feel and
  versatility of water-jet metal cutting, so we decided to start our own metalworks
  shop for artistic, functional architectural objects. Thirteen years later, we’re
  only just beginning.\n\nFounded by Vince and LeaAnne Cassaniti, OceanBlue Living
  has evolved from a two-person workshop into a team of craftspeople with both design
  techniques and technical skillsets who have the knowhow and experience to bring
  your ideas to life.\n \nWe believe in the transformational effect of spaces: spaces
  that people want to be in, that help people work, and live. As our lives become
  faster, having space to regain ourselves becomes more important. The presence and
  natural beauty of our architectural pieces helps create those spaces.\n \nWe're here to help you discover, design and fabricate architectural pieces that will bring your ideas to life and transform your living spaces."
